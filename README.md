# FloatingArrow
A replacement for laser pointer and fingers.

This is designed for touch screen and windows, ideal for using devices like surface pro to show things on a projector.

It's better than a laser pointer because you don't have to hold it and it's bigger.

It's better than you hand and finger because sometimes the screen is out of reach.
